Introduction
============

Hive is an API Server built using NodeJS and Reddis.

It's purpose is to provide API Authors with an infra-structure capable of
supporting the easy development of API's without worrying with things such as:

* Authentication
* Throttling
* Mettering
* Reporting

Other modules may come in time.

Status
======

NOT AVAILABLE.

As you can see from the codebase, not much has been done so far.

We'll keep this document up-to-date with the latest developments.

Roadmap
=======

Next we'll try to get an alpha build that features api redirection with support
to creating users and public/private key pairs.
